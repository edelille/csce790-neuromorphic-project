This video is based on a case that is published in literature, link is in the description below. I don’t intend to scare anyone about food or leftovers. I’ll be eating leftovers for dinner tonight, just like I do every day. This was a freak accident happening in a perfect storm sequence of events, as I will show you. I publish a video every month, so if you hit subscribe and the bell for notifications, we can have some leftover food, together. A Student Ate His Roommate’s Leftover Noodles For Lunch. This Is What Happened To His Limbs. JC is a 19 year old man, presenting to the emergency room with muscle pain, chills, and shortness of breath. Five hours earlier, a purplish discoloration that looked like bruises had developed on his skin, and his roommate immediately drove him to the hospital. In the car, JC could barely move his head because his neck was so stiff but it didn’t matter anymore because his vision was starting to go dark. One day earlier, JC was on his regular schedule. He was hungry for lunch, but it was cold outside. Food wasn’t easy to come by but his roommate had gone out to eat the night before and brought back leftovers. “Hes not really gonna care if I eat this, he wasn’t going to finish it anyways,” JC thought. Immediately after eating the meal of leftover chicken, and noodles, JC didn’t feel well. He could feel his stomach shake and convulse. As the hours passed, JC could feel a blanket of pain covering his stomach. He felt like there was gas, but there was no flatulence. A pool of sour saliva flooded in under his tongue, and he felt a stinging sensation ripple in to his cheeks as he was brought down to the floor. He huddled over the toilet as a stream of stomach contents pushed up every couple minutes as he felt his eyes squeezing out of his skull. Laying down now in a world of hurt, JC felt cold. He started shivering. His arms and legs felt weak and clammy and the blanket of pain started spreading to his chest. It was getting harder to breathe. His head started pounding. He slowly became unaware of his surroundings. When his roommate came back, JC couldn’t turn his head to look at him, and his vision was pulsating and starting to blur. That food must have been no good, he thought. “I ate your leftovers for lunch, but they came right back up,” JC said. “Sorry, I shoulda just tossed it, I didn’t finish that dinner because I barfed it up too,” his roommate said. As the night passed, JC could feel his heart pounding in his chest. His roommate was fine. JC’s head hurt so bad that he was in a fetal position the entire night. “What was it about those leftovers?” He thought. “I shouldn’t have eaten them for sure,” he thought. As the sun started to rise, JC tried to get up to brush his teeth. He noticed some bruising on his arms and legs that weren’t there the day before as he put the toothbrush in his mouth. But everything was in a state of pain and it was just too much. Knowing an ambulance would be too expensive, he begged his roommate to drive him to the hospital as he’s brought to the emergency room, where we are now. At examination, JC was responsive, alert and conscious, but his skin was kind of pale. He had a fever. JC’s heart beat was fast, heart rhythm was normal, but his blood pressure was high, and he had tachypnea. Tachy meaning fast and pnea referring to breath. As doctors were examining him, JC empties his stomach all over the floor. Doctors noticed it was a greenish yellow color, not really looking like any particular kind of food. Doctors drew some blood to test and to get a better idea of what’s happening. But as the minutes pass, JC’s tachypnea started to get worse as he was gasping for air and his face was starting to turn gray. JC has hypoxemia. Hypo meaning low. Ox referring to oxygen and emia meaning presence in blood. Low oxygen presence in blood, but how could this be? He’s breathing faster than normal, and it’s the same air everyone else in the emergency room is breathing, and no one else is gasping like how JC is. Doctors put him on supplemental oxygen to try and fix this. As the hour continues, JC’s blood pressure drops to half of what it was when he arrived to the emergency room. The nurse used a vein in his leg to administer medicine to stimulate his heart to try and get it to beat harder to increase his blood pressure. Doctors sedate him and stick a tube down his throat so that a machine can breathe for him. But it wasn’t enough. JC’s blood pressure kept dropping. But then doctors started to notice a rash containing small spots were emerging all over his body. At first this mottled appearance looked like bruises but then they became a deep reddish brown, well defined at the edges, and multiple lesions like this started appearing all over his body. But how could this happen after eating food that made him and his roommate sick? The fever. The sudden drop in blood pressure. The hypoxemia and the diffuse rash. All of this pointing to a sudden, terrible infection spreading all over JC’s body, as doctors start him on broad spectrum antibiotics. They dont know exactly what bacteria they’re dealing with. They dont know what could have caused this to happen. The best they can do until they find out, is to give an antibiotic that covers many different bacteria. But things are only getting worse. Doctors try to push more medicines in to his body to keep his blood pressure up because it keeps going down. Low pressure means blood can’t get to his organs as they start shutting down. They call for a helicopter because he needs to be transported to another hospital with more resources. In the second hospital now, doctors notice that JC’s hands and feet are cold. Usually, you can feel a pulse, the heart beating, by the hands and the feet. But the medical team couldn’t feel one for JC. The lesions look like more than just bruises now and they’ve spread everywhere. Occasionally, JC would open his eyes, and he would just stare blankly into the void. His pupils still reacted to light. This reflex is natural in humans and means that the brain is still in tact. Both his pupils were the same size, so this tells doctors that his brain is OK, at least for now. What isn’t OK is JC’s kidneys. At the previous hospital, before putting him into the helicopter, the medical team had placed a catheter, that is a tube that will empty the urine in his bladder. But as it turns out, there is no urine in his bladder because his kidneys haven’t made any, and they’ve completely shut down. Another blood test finds that JC has thrombocytopenia. Thromb from Ancient Greek Thrombos meaning a lump or a piece. Cyto meaning cell. And Penia from Ancient Greek referring to Poverty but in this case referring to deficiency. A deficiency of cell pieces known as thrombocytes, which are also called platelets. But what does this mean? You see, blood has the ability to coagulate, it can clump together to form a kind of jelly like consistency. This is called a thrombus made from thrombocytes. Another word for all of this is blood clot. This usually happens in times where the body wants to stop you from bleeding. If clots are made of thrombocytes, but JC has a deficiency of thrombocytes, then it means that he can’t make any more new blood clots, which would mean that he can’t stop bleeding. That could explain his bruise-like rashes all over his body. But JC doesn’t have a history of bleeding problems. He was healthy and fine less than 24 hours ago before he ate his roommate’s leftover food, meaning at some time in between, this thrombocytopenia developed. If his thrombocytes weren’t low before, but are low now suddenly, what happened to them? They could have been destroyed. The remnants of those destroyed would have had to exit JC’s body in some form. But where from? He emptied his stomach multiple times after he had ate that food. Platelets don’t just float into the stomach to be pushed out. JC hasn’t made any urine so they wouldn’t have exited from there either, so it’s not likely they were destroyed. Instead, this could mean JC’s thrombocytopenia could be because his body has consumed all of his thrombocytes by making clots everywhere in his body, but where exactly would they be? When JC presented to the emergency room at the first hospital, the medical team drew blood and sent it to a lab so they could try and grow the bacteria. On the phone now with the previous hospital, the medical team are told the results. The species found in JC’s blood was Neisseria meningitidis. The stiff neck. The nausea declining quickly into respiratory collapse and shock. The thrombocytopenia and multi organ failure. The rash on his cold hands and feet. Doctors had already suspected meningococcemia, meningococcal bacteria presence in blood, by the time these results were confirmed, but at less than 24 hours after eating his roommate’s leftover food for lunch, JC’s kidneys, lungs, heart and blood have all shut down. Even though this is a meningococcal bacterial infection, it doesn’t appear to be meningitis, the inflammation of the meninges the membranes that protect the brain and the spinal cord, even though he had a stiff neck, called nuchal rigidity. But when he presented to the emergency room, he was conscious and everything about his brain seemed to be OK. Instead, the bacteria flooded in to his blood stream, so this isn’t meningitis but it’s meningococcemia. But why is this happening? This brings us back to his blood clots. We can already see where they are. When JC’s body started to react to the meningococcemia, the immune system started responding. It’s kind of like getting a cut on your skin, the bleeding stops eventually because of blood clot, and then the area around the cut becomes swollen and warm. It’s swollen because the blood vessels dilate, so that more blood cells can get to the area, and the swelling is partly due to the fact that there’s increased fluid and warmth is the inflammation. But when bacteria is present in the blood, the entire body’s blood vessels dilate, dropping the blood pressure, preventing oxygen from getting in to the organs. Thrombocytes are consumed causing little clots to form everywhere, as they get lodged into small blood vessels, blocking blood flow. As his hands and feet become cold, they starving of oxygen. A pulse can’t be felt because nothing is flowing through, as the tissue starts to necrose. The bruising happens because the remaining blood that didn’t clot has become thin and is flowing out looking like a bleed. All of this is called Purpura fulminans. Fulminans from Latin Fulmen meaning lightning or thunderbolt, in this case referring to something happening suddenly and Purpura from Greek referring to the color of the bruise that appears suddenly. As the days pass, JC is stabilized, but parts of the tissue on his fingers have necrosed and caused gangrene. Both of his legs down to his feet were also necrosed to the point, that they needed to be amputated, because the tissue can cause even more problems if it starts floating around JC’s body. And they were amputated. The Neisseria meningitidis bacteria is known to spread through saliva, not through the air, which brings us to the final point. JC’s roommate threw up after eating parts of his meal the night before. These became the leftovers that JC ate the next day, not knowing this had happened. This kind of reaction is generally not normal with food, but as doctors got more medical history on JC, they found that he only received the first dose of the meningococcal vaccine just before middle school and not the booster recommended 4 years later at age 16. A second, Serogroup B meningococcal vaccine is usually required for people entering university, which also consists of 2 separate doses, given a couple months apart. JC had gotten this one, but again, only one dose. The evidence appears to point to the food being bad, and that’s a freak accident. We’ll never know exactly what happened to it to cause it to have Neisseria meningitidis on it, it would be hard to even culture and grow it specifically from the noodles, but we know that bacteria is transmitted through saliva. It made his roommate throw it back up, his roommate was up to date on his vaccination schedule, this bacteria doesn’t just materialize out of nowhere, and it caused this infection, it caused parts of JC’s limbs to necrose. And the missed partial vaccines twice on JC’s part was another accident that happened at this particular place, at this particular time. As JC’s organ function starts to come back 26 days later, he becomes conscious again and hes moved to the stepdown unit as his condition starts to improve. Blood products were given to him to replenish the correct coagulation factors in the ICU and other anticoagulants were given aggresively. The bacteria was handled promptly with the correct antibiotics, but the illness caused by it lasted for days. He isn’t critically ill anymore, but he has permanent changes on his body now, as he was able to make a recovery. Thanks so much for watching. Take care of yourself. And be well.

Essential oils  can be very, powerful, just like this mother   son combo will find out. As always, references  to subject matter with links to similar cases   published in literature in the description  below. This is not an uncommon poisoning,   as I will demonstrate in this video, which is published in 8K. I make  a new video every month so if you subscribe,   turn on all notifications and hit like  we’ll get some gas station nachos together. A Boy Accidentally Drank His Mom’s Essential  Oils. This Is What Happened To His Brain. BB is a 3 year old boy, presenting to the  emergency room with nausea, vomiting, and   tachypnea. Tachy meaning fast and pnea referring  to breath. He was breathing quick and struggling. His mother Megan, tells the admitting  nurse that she found her son on the floor   face down in a pool of his own stomach contents.    She turned him over to see his face,  and she couldn’t believe what she saw. 18 months ago, Megan started  having trouble with her arms   and her legs. Everyday, she would notice that  her shoulders and hips would hurt. Her hands   would be swollen up and down her fingers to  the point where just bending them would hurt. Megan thought maybe she had developed arthritis.   You know, body’s different after having kids now,   but this shouldn’t be a problem. Years ago, when  she had just finished college, Megan had gotten   in to essential oils, just as a fun thing  to do with some of her friends. She wanted   to live a more natural lifestyle and she loved  the smell of things like lavender and tangerine. In her mind, she connected the dots, arthritis  and the oils. She remembered, that there’s some   oils that can be used topically for pain,  to calm and cool down what she assumed was   inflammation happening in her body, attacking  her joints and causing pain. She had some of   this wintergreen oil left over from years past.   It’s the same stuff they have in other pain   relief creams that they sell over the counter. “Why not mix it with   some carrier oils and rub it on all the parts  that hurt,” she thought. And everything seemed   to go great. Megan and her son were able to be  happy and healthy because mom was pain free. But a few months later, Megan’s arthritis  came back and it would wax and wane. The oils had child safety caps on top, where  one has to push down with more concentrated   force than a child could know to exert. But  because Megan’s hands would hurt so bad,   she elected to change the caps to ones without  the safety. You could simply screw these ones   on and off, without the need to push down  first. Megan knew the risk of doing this   was that her son could potentially get into  the oils now, but it’s alright she thought,   just make sure to put them out of reach so he  can’t get to them, and there will be no problem, she thought. But there was a problem. One day Megan was  making her wintergreen ointment sitting down   on a coffee table, she got a phone  call from her boss. She stepped aside   as she left all her oils out on a  table. Some ointment was already made,   and so she wasn’t totally aware of how much oil  was left in each bottle when she walked away.    BB not knowing any better, got a hold of the  oils as he started drinking. When she got back,   the bottles of her oils seemed toppled over, it  was kind of messy. She didn’t remember if she had   knocked some over in the rush to pick up the call  from her boss, so she didn’t think too much of it. Over the next several hours, the oils settle  and absorb in to BB’s body and his mother has   no idea what had happened. He starts to  act lethargic, but his breathing becomes   fast and labored. He doesn’t act like how  he normally does for that time of day,   as he empties his stomach on to the carpet.   Megan finds him face down on the floor,   in a panic as she calls for 911 and he’s  brought to the emergency room where we are now. At examination, doctors notice BB  had a fever, and his breathing was   fast and labored. When they listened to his lungs,  they were clear, he didnt have a blocked airway,   so his tachypnea probably isn’t from some kind  of congestion or fluid buildup in his lungs,   at least not yet. Because hes 3 years old, he  can’t verbalize to anyone how he’s feeling.    No one knew he drank anything and he can’t tell  anyone he did. And Megan hasn’t connected in her   mind yet that BB being this way is related to  her essential oils being messy on that table. A blood test finds that BB has low bicarbonate  presence in blood, but what does that mean?   Bicarb is one part of baking soda, which is sodium  bicarbonate. If you remember from middle or high   school, there was a small science experiment where  you mix vinegar with baking soda to get a chemical   reaction because vinegar is an acid and baking  soda is a base. So if BB has low bicarbonate,   then it means he has low base presence in blood.   The body’s a balanced system, so if base is low,   and acid is opposite of base, then it mean he  has too much acid. This is called acidosis.    Acid formally defined as the concentration of  hydrogen ion, and -osis referring to a disorder.    An acid disorder, bringing us to the essential  oils of his mother that he accidentally drank. Some essential oils, probably won’t  cause problems if you drink them.    But some of them are extreme extracts of  things that are fine to put on the skin,   but the moment they get ingested and  absorb into the body, they become poison. Megan used wintergreen oil as an arthritis remedy,  and that’s great. It does an awesome job at that   because the active ingredient contained therein,  is methyl salicylate. The salicylate moiety you   might recognize from the chemical name of aspirin,  acetyl salicylic acid. In the body, they become   the same salicylate, and this is one of the most  common over the counter therapies. Even Pepto   Bismol is known as Bismuth sub salicylate.   You can even find salicylate in face wash. This makes sense with Megan’s use.   Aspirin is an anti inflammatory medicine,   it’s how it relives pain. You could apply it  on the skin where some of it gets absorbed,   or you can take tablets of it by mouth.   The problem is wintergreen oil is really   concentrated. The bottle BB drank  has the equivalent of at least 66   big aspirin tablets. Just 1/3 of this bottle  alone can be fatal if taken by mouth in a child.    And BB drank 3 times that fatal dose, because  he drank the entire bottle. Even though BB   can’t tell doctors what happened, their findings  from examining him give them some more clues. The interesting thing about the body is that  it regulates acid base balance quickly through   breathing. We inhale oxygen. But we exhale CARBON  dioxide. And this bring us back to biCARBONate. The blood delivers oxygen all throughout  the body, so what we breathe in,   goes from our lungs right in to our  blood. But blood is made of water. And   if we’re trying to put oxygen in to it by  inhaling, then it means at the same time,   carbon dioxide is in the blood ready  to get exchanged out by exhaling. The reason why this is important, is because  when Carbon Dioxide is dissolved in Water,   it exists as a balanced system with  biCARBONate and acid. This tells the   medical team a lot about what’s happening  in BB. He has low bicarbonate in his blood,   meaning there’s more acid than base. Going  backwards in the understanding of blood,   hes breathing fast meaning his body is desperately  trying to push excess carbon dioxide out as a way   to fix the acidosis. But things keep getting  worse. BB falls unconscious in the hospital   as he’s admitted in. As doctors take another  blood test, they find that he now has acidemia.    It’s not just low base presence in blood  now, but there’s an acid presence in blood,   meaning that it’s starting to spill all throughout  his body. But where is this acid coming from? This brings us back to BB’s  fever. When energy is consumed,   heat is created. When the body consumes a lot  more energy than it can create, then too much   heat gets generated, leading to hyperthermia,  high body temperature, but why is this happening? Inside the cells, there’s a powerhouse called  the mitochondria. It generates energy in the   form of ATP, by using electricity, the movement of  positive and negative charges, just like you see   on a battery. But when salicylate is inside the  mitochondria, it flows freely going back and   forth wherever it wants, and starts to disturb the  electrical flow. As this short circuit is formed,   ATP isn’t made anymore. But cells need that  energy. They can detect that something is   wrong but they don’t know why. The powerhouse  keeps working harder and harder kind of like   a hamster running in a wheel and because the  wheel doesn’t touch the ground, the hamster   can run forever and not get anywhere. Salicylate  toxicity forces the mitochondria to run in place,   never actually producing any energy. As the  wheels keep spinning faster and harder, massive   amounts of heat are released and because energy is  only consumed and not made in BB’s body anymore,   this is one part of where his carbon  dioxide and acidosis are coming from. The tachypnea, the metabolic acidosis, the  nausea and vomiting before falling unconscious.    Doctors ask Megan if her son had accidentally  eaten something or drank some kind of chemical,   specifically something related to aspirin.    Already in a panic, she said she didnt know, she  didnt think he did, but then it dawned on her.    She left her essential oils out when she  stepped aside to talk to her boss on the phone.    The bottles didnt have child safety caps. She  came back to them and saw a big mess that she   didnt remember leaving. As she tells doctors  every single oil that BB could have drank,   their blood test returns, and it confirms  everything, because he has high salicylate   presence in blood from drinking a bottle bottle  of wintergreen oil, made of methyl salicylate. Finding the problem is great for the doctors, but  things are only getting worse now. BB’s acidemia   is intensifying. More acid has spilled into his  blood compared to just a couple hours before,   and because he’s unconscious now, it  means that his brain is now affected,   but how did the brain get involved?? We’ve already established that cells need a lot  of energy to function, but in toxic settings,   huge amounts of salicylate forces cells  to use more energy than they can create.    One function of cells is to maintain their fluid  balance. A cell doesnt want to be super bloated,   it also doesnt want to be shriveled  up. To maintain the balance of fluid,   cells can’t just pull water from  the outside and shove it in.    But what they can do is manipulate sodium, because  wherever sodium is, water will flow towards it. In this small science experiment, I dissolve  salt in this water and place it into a semi   permeable tube meaning that only water and  nothing else can flow in and out of it.    I place this tube in a pool of distilled  water that has no salt dissolved in it and   you’ll see that water enters the tube. That  water flows towards where there’s sodium. If cells can pump sodium in and  out, they can control their fluid balance. This pumping of electrolytes requires energy, which  if the cells aren’t making anymore and they’re   starting to run out of it, then it means that  they can’t control their own fluid balance. Sodium doesnt get pumped out of  the cell anymore. Water flows in and the cells become bloated. When all the  cells become bloated, the organ becomes bloated.    The brain starts to swell up and expand into the  skull. But this is only the start of the problem. The thing about salicylate as a chemical is  that it exists as a second form, in a balance   with itself as salicylic acid. Salicylate has  an electrical property associated with it,   a negative charge. The reason this is important,  is because when a chemical has a charge,   it cannot enter or exit a cell by itself. But  salicylic acid isn’t charged. Salicylic acid,   enters and exits cells however and whenever  it wants to. And because BB has acidemia,   a high hydrogen ion presence in blood, it means  that there’s so much hydrogen floating around,   salicylate only exists as salicylic acid, as it  now starts to flood in to every single organ. The brain’s not only swelling now because it  doesnt have enough energy to maintain fluid   balance, but it starts discharging. The heart  starts beating in strange rhythms because muscle   needs a lot of energy, but as salicylic  acid disturbs all ATP production,   the cells can’t keep up. Fluid starts flowing  in to the lungs because those cells don’t   have enough energy to maintain fluid balance.   BB’s body tried the best it could to breathe   out extra carbon dioxide and push out the acid  in his blood to protect his organs from this,   but the flood of wintergreen oil he  drank simply overwhelmed this mechanism. Is there anything the medical team can do at this  point to reverse this? By the time they asked   Megan if BB had accidentally eaten something or  drank some kind of chemical, they started to take   measures for what they thought could be happening.   If he has acidemia and acidosis, specifically has   low bicarbonate presence in blood, then the answer  is to give him bicarbonate. This will push the   balance of acid down. As more base is infused in  to his blood, it prevents salicylate from becoming   salicylic acid, forcing it to keep its electrical  charge so it can’t enter in to his organs. Additional measures were taken by doctors to force  base in to BB’s urine. This allows the body to use   the kidneys to filter and concentrate salicylate  so that it can be eliminated in the urine. There isn’t much that can be done once most  salicylate becomes salicylic acid in the body   during a toxic event because there isn’t an easy  way to suck it out of the organs. In some cases,   patients will appear to be ok and within a couple  hours, the aspirin toxicity will overtake them,   permanently. The clinical decline can  happen quickly and suddenly in this setting.    The only thing we can do now is to make the blood  basic as quickly as possible to prevent all of   that from happening. And luckily the medical team  were able to catch it just in time in BB’s case. After several days in the hospital,  and a lesson learned by Megan to take   great caution in never exposing  any risk ever with any potential   household danger to her son, BB  was able to make a full recovery. Thanks so much for watching. Take  care of yourself. And Be Well.

This is a case that happened in the United States, de-identified for the patient, but her story of how she got to where she did, may not be too unfamiliar. As always, references to subject matter with links to similar cases published in literature in the description below. I make a new video every month so if you subscribe and hit like we’ll get some gas station sushi together. A Woman Drank 35% Hydrogen Peroxide At Lunchtime. This Is What Happened To Her Brain. KJ is a 40 year old woman, presenting to the emergency room, with her eyes wide open, but she was completely unresponsive. She was foaming at the mouth. You see, KJ could never remember a time in her life, when she was healthy. When she was young, she had an eating disorder that would periodically put her in the hospital. Oftentimes doctors would document she had an acute onset psychosis with delusions and hallucinations because of hypoglycemia. Hypo meaning low. Glyc from Greek referring to glucose or sugar and emia meaning presence in blood. Her erratic eating habits caused hypoglycemia, which can cause changes in one’s mental status resulting in hallucinations, delusions and acute onset psychosis. Skin deep, this could have been the cause of all her problems, but there was a lot more going on. KJ eventually got the help she needed for her eating disorder, but she never really seemed to get healthier. She was always sick with a cold or the flu. Sometimes she’d have a headache and couldn’t go to school because of it. She was always exhausted, she’d get a rash on her face if she was out in the sun for too long, and she’d have body aches and chills before eventually, acute onset psychosis would bring her back to the hospital. To KJ, these were serious issues, but to everyone else, she was being a drama queen. You have a headache? Well you sleep too late at night her mom would say. You have a rash on your face after being in the sun? What a big surprise, that’s called sunburn, sweety, mom would say. At doctors visits, her mom would often interject when the doctor asked a question. Mom downplayed all of KJ’s signs and symptoms giving doctors the impression that things weren’t as severe as KJ described. And sometimes, Mom would just refuse to bring KJ to the hospital, locking KJ in her room, telling her to figure it all out herself. As an adult, KJ couldn’t understand why she felt so awful all the time, but she just accepted it as fact. Maybe she did feel fine, that it was all in her head, so maybe she should just keep quiet, she thought. In the hospital for an acute onset psychosis at the age of 24, doctors put KJ on antipsychotic medicines, but she didn’t need antipsychotic medicines. When she was ready to go home, the nurse involved in her care wrote a name and a phone number on a card and urged KJ to call it and schedule an appointment. Not wanting to step on doctors’ toes, the nurse suspected KJ had autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks the body. The nurse brought it up on psychiatric rounds, the blood tests were borderline, the signs and symptoms were nonspecific meaning they could have been a variety of different things, but everything was shrugged off. At the rheumatology doctor’s office, KJ was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, also known as Lupus. This made sense with all of her problems, the rash on her face, the flare ups, always getting sick, the muscle aches and pains, and the acute onset psychosis. Lupus is a time when the immune system is actively attacking the body and having the diagnosis finally brought KJ to peace, her health problems weren’t in her mind, her mom was wrong, she wasn’t being a drama queen and doctors were overlooking this and they didn’t have KJ’s health in their best interests, she thought. She took medicines for this lupus, and everything was OK But a few years later, things started to get worse again. KJ had swelling in her hands and feet, she had trouble with her shoulders and hips as doctors determined her immune system had been attacking them to the point of rheumatoid arthritis, where the immune system starts attacking the bones and the joints causing permanent damage. This new disease would mean that she would have to take more medicines, and even then, there’s no guarantee that she won’t need things like a hip replacement later in life given how aggressively her immune system had been attacking her joints. But KJ had had enough. She had been taking all these medicines for her lupus for all these years, and she didn't get any better, she ended up developing even more disease she thought. And now with this arthritis, doctors wanted her to take this cocktail of medicines that she couldn’t even afford. If they had only taken her more seriously when she was younger, maybe all of this could have been prevented, she thought as she went online and tried to find her own therapies. A while back, someone had recommended to KJ about these alternative therapies for her lupus. At first, it was smelling some oils, and she didn’t really feel much better, maybe a little. But as she dived deeper into this space, she came across hydrogen peroxide therapy. The communities online were adamant, hydrogen peroxide is basically water, with an extra oxygen. You’re not just having a glass of H2O, you gonna be chugging a glass of H2O2. And without a doubt, that oxygen is totally what KJ’s body needed, because when extra oxygen is present, bad things can’t happen to your cells. And you know, the immune system attacking your body is just bad things happening to your cells, so definitely to fix KJ’s body she needed this oxygen. KJ was skeptical at first because she knew these alternative therapies could be suspect. Maybe something was there but nothing was standard. None of the communities agreed on a route of administration for this, because truth is you really shouldn’t be putting this in your body. Some sources said to infuse it directly in to the blood, but KJ wasn’t going to do that. Some sources said do not take by mouth but others said it was fine so long as it was diluted. In the end, KJ decided that she would start by diluting some and rubbing it on her skin so that the oxygen will absorb right into her body. And after a few weeks as she got more comfortable, she would start diluting the hydrogen peroxide to drink. And this is what she did. KJ would purchase 35% “food grade” hydrogen peroxide bottles from big box retail stores. She read online that refrigerating the 35% peroxide would help stabilize it chemically, so she’d put it in her fridge right alongside her food. It was “food grade” anyways, so no problem here, she thought. One day, KJ transferred the 35% hydrogen peroxide into clear gallon water jugs. She only drank distilled water now because tap water had impurities that she believed, made her lupus worse. She didnt know why when she bought the hydrogen peroxide from the store it came in an opaque bottle. She made her own inference that the peroxide needed to absorb the energy and positive vibes from around it so that when it was in her body, it would just cure her of all the autoimmunity that plagued her organs and joints. 35% hydrogen peroxide is dangerous. If left on the skin, it can be corrosive because it reacts and does in fact, release a bunch of oxygen. KJ made an effort to make sure she marked the water bottles as hydrogen peroxide, but this time, she was distracted and forgot, and put them back into the fridge without marking them. One day at lunchtime, KJ was thirsty and needed to drink some water. She reached in for a bottle and poured herself a cup, and this time for real, she was drinking H2O2, 35%. Immediately after taking a couple sips of the concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution, she could feel it fizz and bubble on the way down. At first she was panicked and didn't know what was happening because she could feel air just blow right out of her nose, but then she realized she drank the concentrated solution. She had been meaning to increase the concentration anyways so that she could optimize the amount of oxygen in her body. And this was the last thing she would remember as she collapsed to the floor and started emptying her stomach. People who were staying with her came to see the commotion as KJ became completely unresponsive even though her eyes were wide open as she was foaming at the mouth and they call for 911 and she’s brought to the emergency room where we are now. At examination, doctors find that KJ’s blood pressure was high and she had a decreased level of consciousness. No one knew she drank 35% hydrogen peroxide, although they suspected she might have consumed something because she was foaming at the mouth. What doctors did know for sure, was that KJ only had reflexes on one side of her body. This is called hemiplegia, hemi meaning half and plegia referring to paralysis. KJ was paralyzed on one side of her body, meaning something could be wrong with her brain, giving doctors some clues as to what’s happening. A scan of KJ’s brain, revealed that parts of it were ischemic. Isch- derived from Greek meaning a holding back of and -emia meaning presence of blood. So parts of KJ’s brain weren’t getting enough blood flow and therefore not getting enough oxygen which could explain why she’s paralyzed on one side of her body, but how would something like this happen with hydrogen peroxide? It’s supposed to hyperoxygenate parts of the body, right? That’s what they say, but what’s happening to KJ is a result of too much oxygen present, and so much, that it’s blocking blood flow in her brain. You see, when hydrogen peroxide comes in contact with human tissue, it reacts. The reason why chemicals react is so that they can become more stable, meaning hydrogen peroxide when it’s concentrated like 35%, can be a little unstable. It breaks down to water, that’s stable, and oxygen, also stable, but when it does this, it releases a lot of heat. In almost all known living beings, cells have metabolic activity, so they’re creating and using energy to function. A consequence of this activity is the production of some hydrogen peroxide. We’ve already established that it can be unstable, and so cells want to stabilize Hydrogen Peroxide by promoting its breakdown to, water and oxygen, and cells have the machinery to do this through an enzyme, a protein, known as catalase. Cells generally have an idea of how much hydrogen peroxide will be in their environment as a result of their metabolism, because they’re adapted to it. That’s normal to them. They don’t have an idea of when 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide is going to be ingested. As KJ drank it, the huge influx of hydrogen peroxide reacted in her cells. And because a lot of heat is released when that happens, those cells get burned and the tissue becomes injured. Doctors noticed caustic burns in her mouth and throat when the foaming started to subside. When you consume something by mouth, it goes into your stomach, in to your intestines and then absorbs into your liver where it goes into your blood stream. Some of the bubbles will absorb in, but hydrogen peroxide also keeps reacting as it goes down, causing those gas bubbles to get in to the liver before it gets in the blood. But, blood contains hemoglobin, which is a protein that has something called Heme, an iron containing compound, which is how blood delivers oxygen to the rest of the body. And this kind of iron also happens to encourage hydrogen peroxide to breakdown to water and oxygen. Typically, you want to have water and oxygen in the blood, because that’s what it’s made of, but the problem is the amount. 1 milliliter of 35% hydrogen peroxide liberates 100 milliliters of oxygen. So just 5 milliliters of 35% hydrogen peroxide liberates an entire breath’s volume worth of oxygen. Imagine an air bubble that large floating around your body. The blood can only have so much oxygen in it before it can’t have anymore. It’s kind of like how water can only have so much salt dissolved in it. Or coffee can only have so much sugar in it. Then the bubbles start to form in the blood, blocking flow. When this gets to the brain, blood cant flow through anymore, meaning even if KJ had “hyper oxygenated” her body with hydrogen peroxide, she’s actually blocked blood flow with oxygen bubbles, causing ischemia, a holding back of the presence of blood, leading to permanent brain damage. Is there anything doctors can do to reverse this? Maybe. This brings us to a concept called solubility. Salt dissolving in water is a solid dissolving in a liquid. But oxygen dissolving in blood is a gas dissolving in a liquid. Gases have a lot of particles which are moving around and have a lot space in between. When pressure is increased, the average space between gas particles decreases and the particles come in to contact with the liquid more often, helping to increase the amount of gas that can dissolve in liquid. If KJ’s blood can’t hold anymore oxygen because hydrogen peroxide has liberated huge amounts of oxygen in, then one solution would be to put her in a high pressure chamber to force more oxygen in to her blood. We would just need enough to break up the blockage in her brain to get more blood flowing though. This hyperbaric oxygen therapy isn’t available at all hospitals, but luckily for KJ, the one she was at did have it, as she was sent in. The US Poison Centers have logged these accidental hydrogen peroxide ingestion cases, it’s been reported hundreds of times over the last 10 years, so that’s a minimum of how many times this has happened, because sometimes it doesnt get reported, or a patient can be admitted into the hospital and no one would have ever known about the case being related to hydrogen peroxide ingestion. And just a quick commentary on the folks selling hydrogen peroxide as medicine. At 35% concentration, it’s considered a hazardous material to ship, hazmat, but yet food grade is on the label making people think it’s no big deal. Other times online, within the same item title, they call it both 35% and 7. 99% together. It can only be one of these, so not sure how they’re justifying it as 35%. And as for hydrogen peroxide use, you might remember a time when it was used to clean cuts and wounds. Since maybe mid 2000’s, hydrogen peroxide is not commonly recommended for that irrigation as it appears it really doesnt do that much against bacteria that might get in the wound, and in some cases, hydrogen peroxide might impede wound healing, and in 1 reported case, it led to gas bubbles blocking blood flow in the hospital in a patient, bringing us back to KJ. After hyperbaric oxygen therapy, her brain no longer had signs of ischemia. Doctors treated the caustic injury to her throat and esophagus. After more than a week in the hospital, KJ was sent to a rehabilitation center to try and regain the function she lost during this brain injury, as she was able to make a recovery. I understand when people have grievances with the health system, but turning to this dark side not only didn't help KJ’s autoimmune disease, it caused other major issues that could have been prevented. Thanks so much for watching. Take care of yourself. And be well.

Student Ate 108 Gummy Antacids For Breakfast. This Is What Happened To Her Kidneys.   JT is a 22 year old woman, presenting to the emergency room confused. Doctors held up 2 fingers and asked her how many they were holding up, and she responded “11. ” When JT was in high school, something really, really terrible happened to her. She always had some stomach pain as a kid. Her parents thought it was heart burn from all the spicy food she would eat. She’d eat a whole bag of hot chips and lie about it blaming it all on her brother. But as time went on, her stomach pain kept getting worse. One day, JT went to the bathroom after breakfast, and emptied her stomach in to the toilet. It wasn’t just her breakfast that came up, it was blood, everywhere. In the emergency room, doctors sent a camera down her throat to look inside her stomach, and they found a giant ulcer. Doctors took a sample of it, and determined that this was caused by bacteria that shouldn’t have been there. Ulcers are kind of like those sores you get in your mouth, but they’re in your stomach. And the stomach has acid, which aggravates the ulcer making things hurt more and more. The ulcer can dig deeper into the lining of the stomach like it did for JT causing a bleed, explaining her hematemesis. JT’s parents knew for sure, those spicy foods and hot chips she wouldn’t stop eating caused the ulcer. They argued with doctors, who knew this was caused by bacteria,— the spicy foods made things worse, but they’re not the cause. Doctors instructed her to stop eating that food, her parents were on board with that. Doctors gave her antibiotics to kill the bacteria, and medicines to control her stomach acid. And everything seemed to be OK. JT was sent home and she was feeling great. But a week later, JT’s personality started to shift. Every morning when she woke up, she struggled with terrible and dark thoughts. She would have random panic attacks where she felt like she couldn’t breathe. At night time, she would have the awful feeling that she wasn’t going to make it. She became a completely different person. Her parents didn’t understand what was happening to her, but it was absolutely the doctors’ fault. When they demanded an answer, the doctors said “you know, she’s 17 and going through puberty, of course she’s gonna change. ” But JT’s parents argued back. The doctors’ poisonous medicines were absolutely causing this, destroying their daughter’s life. And they weren’t going to take it. Antibiotics can change the gut microbiome, which is the bacteria living in the stomach and intestines. More and more research suggests that that bacteria could have some impact on the brain, so killing them with antibiotics taken by mouth, could change some balance in the body. This is rare, but it might be a real reaction to the medicines the doctors thought, so they wrote her a prescription for a different antibiotic, but JT and her parents had had enough. Their truth was the spicy food alone was causing all of this, and so they threw the antibiotics in the trash. As the weeks and months passed, JT’s personality slowly reverted back to normal. She turned to herbal supplements to help calm and cool her body down. Occasionally, her stomach would hurt, but all of this seemed to pass. The bleeding ulcer and the resulting personality change was the terrible thing that happened in high school. In her senior year of college now, the pharmacy where JT got her herbal supplements was out of stock. She knew from past experience that antacids like Tums and Alkaseltzer would help. She felt like her ulcer never really went away. Maybe she had grown out of the pain, or she had gotten used to it, but she still needed something to neutralize her stomach acid, and live pain free. JT found new GUMMY antacids. Why not try it out? she thought. Regular chewy tablets were chalky, she didn’t like that texture, so she bought some bottles of the gummies, and started eating them. At first, she would have just a few in the morning with breakfast. But as the days passed, those gummy antacids BECAME her breakfast. She noticed the more gummies she ate, the more spicy foods she could have. Finally I can eat the food I want to eat, she thought Antacids are usually made of calcium carbonate. It neutralizes stomach acid and closes up the two part of the stomach where it connects to the esophagus, helping with heart burn. Someone on an internet forum said calcium was good especially for women to help build up the bones, preventing osteoporosis, so not only was JT healing her stomach, she was strengthening her bones, too, she thought. And everything was good. This was the best she had felt in years. But then strange things started to happen. She noticed she would urinate at least 2 times an hour throughout the day, to the point where she had no idea where that water was coming from. But then things started spiraling out of control. One morning, she woke up at 7am. When she was done brushing her teeth, it was 1 in the afternoon. She had no idea how she brushed her teeth for 6 hours, but things kept getting worse. One morning, JT tried to get out of bed, but her knees felt weak. She sat at the computer watching a class lecture while eating her gummy antacid breakfast. She didnt realize she ate 2 whole bottles totaling 108 gummies. In the bathroom, dizzy. JT fell down before emptying her stomach into the toilet, as she calls for 911 and she’s brought to the emergency room where we are now. At examination, doctors knew something was wrong. Her reflexes were weak. When they asked her who is the current president, she said Abraham Lincoln. And when they asked her what is meant by the phrase, “don’t put all your eggs in 1 basket,” she stared off into space before responding “I like turtles” Clearly, JT has something wrong with her brain due to the fact that she just ate 108 gummy antacids for breakfast, but doctors don’t know that. She isn’t in a mental state where she could tell them that, even if they asked. A scan of her brain looked fine, it didn’t seem like anything was wrong just from the picture, but as she sat in the emergency room waiting for doctors, she emptied her stomach again on to her patient gown and had 2 more seizures before she was sent to the intensive care unit where a blood test reveals that JT has hypercalcemia. Hyper meaning high. Calc referring to calcium, an important mineral and electrolyte in the body. And Emia meaning presence in blood. High calcium presence in blood. If she ate 108 calcium carbonate gummies, and had been eating almost a bottle every day, this makes sense why she would have high calcium presence in blood, but in the intensive care unit, no one knows this is what happened. Doctors do additional tests. The calcium is so high in her blood, it’s life threatening. And something that high doesnt happen on its own. In the body, the bones are the largest stores of calcium. Doctors need to make sure her bones aren’t dissolving in her body, leaking calcium everywhere. This can happen because of a hormone imbalance or because of a tumor somewhere. As the doctors await the test results, they find that JT is not only dehydrated, but that her kidneys have started shutting down, but what does this have to do with gummy antacids? How is this even remotely related to calcium carbonate? You see, the body, especially the nerves and muscles, use electricity to send signals. Electricity is like the plus and minus that you see on batteries, and, calcium has a plus 2 charge. If there’s high calcium presence in blood, the calcium tends to block signals going in to cells. If the nerves and muscles rely on electricity to signal and do things, then if too much calcium is around blocking those signals, then it explains why JT’s weak. And why her brain can’t signal for her to speak coherently, before everything shut down and she started having seizures. But this isn’t her only problem. In the kidneys, urine is produced by manipulating sodium, because wherever sodium is, water will flow towards it. In this small science experiment, I dissolve salt in this water and place it into a semi-permeable tube. I place the tube in a pool of distilled water and you’ll see that water flows towards the sodium. That water flows towards where there’s salt. When urine is being made, the kidneys rely on electricity, balancing plus and minus charges. Sodium is a + 1 charge and the kidneys do everything they can to hold on to enough sodium to retain water so that the person doesn’t become dehydrated. When too much calcium is present, it stops the kidneys from holding on to any sodium, so everything becomes urine, causing massive water loss. This is why JT couldn’t stop urinating during those days where she was eating gummy antacids like candy. But it’s still not over yet. The blood is a soup of several chemicals. Calcium has a tendency to make solid salts. So big chemicals like phosphate and oxalate which you eat in your diet have negative charges and attract to calcium. They grow in size, creating solids that collect in the kidneys, as stones form, blocking flow and pointing to permanent damage in JT’s case. All of this is called Milk Alkali Syndrome. Ulcers aren’t uncommon, and they’re not new. Humans have had them for thousands of years. In the early 1900s, doctors thought maybe it was stomach acid flaring up, that would keep irritating the ulcer, preventing it from healing. Neutralizing that acid with milk and cream given once an hour, and then giving baking soda allowed patients to heal from all of this. This milk alkali therapy became the way to treat ulcers. But very quickly, doctors realized that doing this was toxic in humans because of the Hypercalcemia from the milk and the alkalemia, alkaline, opposite of an acid, presence in blood from the baking soda. Milk alkali syndrome decreased in incidence throughout the 1970s because we had newer medicines that could better control how the stomach produces acid. But what’s forgotten becomes new again, as more recently in the 2010’s, people are more often self medicating for various stomach ailments with over the counter calcium carbonate. Which is fine, but don’t take more than what the label says, because Hypercalcemia can happen quickly, and these are not candy, no matter how good they taste. If JT’s problem is all caused by Hypercalcemia, there isn’t a way to suck the calcium directly out of her blood. The only real route out, is through the kidneys. If they’re shutting down, the only way to do this now is to rehydrate her and get water flowing back through her kidneys. Additional medicines were given to force her kidneys to excrete calcium in the urine, as her blood calcium levels started to decrease over days. As JT regains consciousness, she’s confused because she has no idea why she’s in the hospital. When the doctors walk in to her room to talk to her, they ask her what she knows about eating antacids, and her eyes immediately light up as she explains that those gummies saved her from the ulcer and enabled her to eat all the foods she loved. She didn’t realize that eating them like candy is the reason why she’s in the hospital in the first place. At discharge, doctors were able to warn her the life threatening dangers of eating more than just a couple gummy antacids. They were able to advise her on non-excessive stomach ulcer treatment. But with a severe episode of hypercalcemia like this, after eating 108 gummy antacids for breakfast, her permanent kidney damage put her on dialysis as she could not make a recovery. Thanks so much for watching. Take care of yourself. And be well.

everyone, Doctor Bernard here. This case seems to be about forbidden cherry lemonade, but probably not gonna taste that way. Before we get into this case, state Poison Centers all across the United States get a lot of calls about glowsticks during 4th of July, and Halloween. If you, or a child, or someone elderly has ingested a glowstick, or really any other poison, in the US, you can call your poison center at 1 800 222 1222, you’ll be connected to a doctor or nurse, they’ll keep it anonymous and they will help you out. Monthly medical cases from me delivered to your YouTube notifications if you click subscribe, hit the bell and all notifications, and refreshing cherry lemonade for all who drink the like button. A Man Mistakenly Drank 6 Glowsticks At Bedtime. This Is What Happened To His Stomach AC is a 26 year old man, presenting to the emergency room with nausea and insomnia.   He tells the admitting nurse that it was only a matter of time— he was about to reenter the evolutionary level, above human. You see, AC wasn’t doing well. Since he finished college and started working, his life had been a struggle. When everything became work at home, AC couldn’t focus on anything. Everyday, there would be calls he would have to be on, but he’d space out. Things he would have done if he were back in the office, weren’t getting done. 90% of all of these calls should be an email, it’s absurd that I have to sit through this longwinded nonsense talking about nothing, he thought. As the months passed, AC saw his career hit a ceiling. Everyone he started the job with were moving up, but he was stuck at the starting point. All he got from his manager was false hope that things were going to get better, that there would be more opportunities available, but nothing ever happened. Disillusioned, AC started despising anything that reminded him of big companies like the one that he worked for. He knew he had a higher purpose in life, that there existed an evolutionary plane for him to ascend to, and everyone else at work belonged to this lower level, existing only to pump someone else’s stock price. And just it couldn’t be me, he thought. One day before a halloween celebration, AC had gotten a pack of glow sticks in a car emergency kit he got from his work. On the label was a big statement saying, “do not puncture or cut” and “do not drink or ingest. ” Upset that a package had the audacity to tell him what to do, he went to a store to buy even more glowsticks. Big Glowstick cant tell me what to do, he thought, as he cracked the sticks to light them up, and started biting down to drink the juice. As the glow stick liquid touched his tongue, AC immediately felt it start burning. On the way down in to his throat, he could feel little bits of what he thought were plastic, scratching the back of his mouth as it all washed down. It was greasy on his hands, but the liquid slid down smoothly. He was disappointed that it wasn’t blue raspberry flavor. As the hours passed, AC didn’t feel well. He felt like he was going to empty his stomach after dry heaving multiple times in the bathroom. And as he finally couldn’t take the pain and discomfort anymore, he calls for 911 and he’s brought to the emergency room, where we are now. At examination, doctors find that AC is in mild distress, but overall, he seemed to be ok. And that’s because, glowsticks are generally not acutely toxic. The little bits and plastic pieces, maybe glass in some cases inside, can be choking hazards, but of the chemicals inside that make the sticks glow for a short amount of time, there generally isn’t documentation that this is acutely toxic causing significant morbidity and mortality. With that said, these are still chemicals that you dont want to put inside your body. Generally, the formulations will have different chemicals responsible for the temporary light. Many times these are dyes, which are irritants to mucous membranes like the mouth, nose or eyes, and the stomach. Some glowsticks have hydrogen peroxide, which can be acutely toxic, but the amount in a stick is not like drinking a concentrated solution out of a bottle. Glowsticks also have chemicals called phthalates, which help plastics be more flexible. This is likely the oily part of AC’s drink. When you see these kinds of shapes in chemical structures, they could potentially interfere with hormones in your body. These can be called endocrine disrupters. They could impact cell activity too, so in the long term, we don’t know, it could cause undesired changes in the body. Kids often ingest glowsticks accidentally. They’ll crawl around during Halloween or 4th of July and if you’re a parent, you might see your kids’ mouths and tongues glowing cause they ate a glowstick. But it doesn’t stop there, sometimes, the accidental ingestion can happen at the bar or the club, because glowsticks might be part of your drink. If you’ve been exposed to some glowstick liquid, rinse with water if it’s on your skin. Wash at least 15 minutes if it gets in your eyes. If it’s swalled accidentally, eat a small snack and drink some water. Upset stomach and nausea can happen because of the irritants. If someone drank a stick and they’re choking, call 911, that’s immediately life threatening. And in the United States, call 1-800-222-1222 to talk to a doctor or nurse at your state poison center if you need help. After some care in the emergency room, and realizing that he wasn’t going to reenter any “evolutionary level above human,” he’d have to go back to work again the next day, AC was able to make a full recovery. Take care of yourself. Thanks so much for watching. And be well.

I have merch! You can find it link in the video description below or at chubbyemu. store. A Mukbanger Ate 1 Gallon (3. 78 Liters) of Pickles For Lunch. This Is What Happened To Her Brain.   BT is a 33 year old woman, presenting to the emergency room with nausea, vomiting, and a splitting headache. She tells the admitting nurse that she had never had less food inside her body than at this moment, because several gallons of liquid had just exited her body, from the end that was supposed to put out solid waste. Earlier in the day, BT was trying to record a pickle mukbang. Since March 2020, she had lost all interest in work, when everything became “work at home. ” Her job in sales, became a job of making it look like work was happening, when really nothing was getting done because everything was just endless, long-winded virtual calls of co-workers talking about nothing. She felt her career had become something that could have been an email. Sometimes when she was required to be on camera, but didnt need to say anything, she would point her work computer’s webcam at a video loop of herself on her tablet to make it look like she was there, but really, she was off doing her own thing. BT loved mukbangs, where people would eat food on camera. She found these therapeutic, where she could eat with a feeling like someone else was there with her. If no one was taking work seriously, and she now had all this extra time on her hands, then why not make a few mukbangs myself now, she thought. For BT, almost instantly, she had an audience. Every day, she’d notice the same names commenting. They would send her messages and tips and as she made more videos, she knew exactly what to expect. But she wanted more. To grow her audience, she noticed that when she ate something different or excessive, she’d attract bigger and bigger numbers. One day, while in the grocery store, BT found gallon jars of pickles. She remembered seeing earlier that other people had posted themselves eating these gallon jars, and those videos got huge numbers. But, she needed to be different. Maybe she could just eat the gallon and enjoy it, without the need for a rush. She looked on her phone and pickles are healthy and low in calories, so it’s going to be no problem, she thought, and she bought the gallon jug, and prepped herself for the feast. At home now, excited for lunch, BT cracked open the jug, and started eating the pickles. She felt good. She loved the crunch of the cucumber on her teeth as the pickle juice dripped out with flavor. Nothing like a nutritious meal, she thought as she started explaining to her audience the health benefits of pickles. Pickles are cucumbers and cucumbers are vegetables, so all of this is obviously healthy. And you know what? Athletes use pickle juice to replenish their electrolytes and prevent cramps, and can you believe this? It’s also a probiotic, so undoubtedly it helps with digestion, and because stomach bacteria affects the brain, it basically just heals the whole body, she said to everyone as she slowly finished the gallon jar of the pickles. She had to take a few bathroom breaks inbetween. And then she started drinking the juice. By this time her lips were all puckered up from all the vinegar and she could feel some sores in her mouth, but this didnt matter, because there’s nothing wrong with a good pickle, she thought. Immediately after finishing the whole gallon of pickles, BT felt bloated. She had seen some people get sick trying to eat it quickly, so doing it slower was absolutely the right thing to do. But about 20 minutes after her last sip of the juice, BT could feel her stomach rumble. At first, it was just a just a little shake, but very quickly, it felt like her stomach was folding on itself as she clenched her body together as hard as she could, and ran to the bathroom. On the toilet now, BT felt like all her organs had liquefied and exited her body into the bowl. As the hours passed, she felt almost every drop of water squeeze out of her body, as her stomach and her intestines kept shaking and quaking. In a world of hurt, she imagined her brain getting sucked out of her skull and flushed into the toilet as the trembling in her abdomen become more and more intense. After all this time, she had no urge to drink any water. Laying down now, BT could swear her skin was inside out. She could see herself kneeling on the floor while staring at the wall. She couldn’t speak but she wished she could. As she replayed herself eating the pickles, she was there being laughed at and confused. It kept everyone watching pleasantly amused enough to stay. But as it starts to feel like an ice pick had been jammed into her head from the back, she becomes weak, and she calls for 911, as she’s brought to the emergency room where we are now. At examination, BT told doctors something about pickles. It wasn’t coherent because she was slurring her words. They weren’t exactly sure what happened. But there’s several clues as to what could be happening because she smells like pickles, and a blood test reveals that she has Acute Hypernatremia. Hyper meaning high. Natr referring to sodium or more formally natrium as indicated by its symbol on the periodic table of elements. And emia meaning presence in blood. High sodium presence in blood. Acute meaning that there were no underlying problems that are leading to this issue, aside from the 1 gallon of pickles inside her body at the moment, which brings us to the first clue. Pickles are high in sodium. The one gallon that BT ate has at least 20 grams of sodium in just pickles alone, not counting the pickle juice that she drank. If the juice has the same sodium content as the small pickle juicer bottles, then the juice alone could be around 10-15 grams of sodium. But this brings us to the difference between sodium and salt. Table salt is usually sodium chloride, that’s a chemical solid made of sodium and chloride. The reason why this is important, is because baking soda, which doesnt really taste salty, can also cause hypernatremia because it’s sodium bicarbonate. If BT packed around 30 grams of sodium into her body during the gallon pickle mukbang, then it’s like she ate 78 grams of table salt. This is a problem because 40 grams of table salt, can be lethal, as doctors see BT quickly start to lose consciousness and have a seizure. The medical team notes that BT doesn’t respond when they call her name. She’s still breathing, but she doesnt respond to pain, her muscles seem stiff, but when they shine a light into her eyes, they notice that her pupils do respond. All of this meaning that something is happening to her brain, but why? This brings us back to hypernatremia, high sodium presence in blood. If a potentially lethal dose of sodium went in to her body, then that should explain it, but, is that real? She had watery stools for hours, meaning there was a net flow out of her body. So, wouldn’t the sodium have exited her body there? Maybe. You see, the interesting thing about sodium is that wherever it is, water will flow towards it. In this small science experiment, I take salty water and place it into a semi-permeable tube, meaning only water can flow in and out of it. I submerge the tube in a pool of distilled water that has no salt in it. And you’ll see that water flows in to the tube. That water flows towards where there's sodium. If a gallon of pickles and juice were sitting inside BT’s stomach and intestines, and water follows sodium, then it means not only is the gallon in there, but more water was drawn in to her gut. This explains why she felt bloated after finishing the jar. But the stomach and intestines are muscles, so when they stretch because water is flowing in, that reflex ripples down and tells the other end of the GI tract to push things out. This reflex explains why you use the toilet after a big meal. But in BT’s case, it was a big stretch. And all those watery stools are big a problem, bringing us to the next clue. The thing about hypernatremia, is that it’s measured as the amount of sodium per liter of water. We already know BT ate a lethal amount of sodium from the pickles, but this isn’t her only problem. She also has massive water loss after hours on the toilet. She doesn’t just have high sodium presence in blood, she has less total body water. When the denominator is a smaller number, the value increases, making the sodium measurement even more concentrated. She may have put out some sodium from the watery stools, but the blood levels point to the fact that the sodium absorbed in to her body from the small intestines into her blood… And if water follows sodium, then it means BT’s salty blood is sucking water out of all her organs. The muscles hold on to water, so if they lose some volume, it could cause some cramps, maybe explaining why she’s stiff. The liver is big, and if it shrivels up, maybe something could go wrong there, but probably not too big of a deal. But if she’s had a seizure and is unresponsive and unconscious, and those are related to the brain, then it means her brain is shrinking because she’s so salty. As the water gets sucked out of her brain quickly, the blood vessels shear and rip apart. This bleeding can cause permanent damage. If she’s lost a lot of water, then the answer is to replace that water, and add even more to try to dilute the sodium. We can’t pull out the sodium from her body, but the more water present, the lower the sodium as the medical team starts fluids to rehydrate her, but, something’s wrong. When there’s hypernatremia, the brain will try as hard as it can to resist shrinking. It makes itself saltier by pumping things in so that less water gets drawn out. This adaptation takes around a day to happen. Meaning if the medical team corrects BT’s hypernatremia quickly, then the brain might be too salty from the adaptation, and the water needed to correct her hypernatremia would swell in, causing to brain to expand, maybe to the point of crushing up against the sides of the skull. The medical team don’t know how long ago she ate all the pickles. They don’t know exactly the details of how it all went down for her. But it seems to be working. BT seems to be doing ok. But as the hours pass, her blood pressure starts to drop. Her kidneys stop making urine as they completely shut down. But her reflexes were still in tact. Her pupils still reacted to light. So it may not yet be too late. And it wasn’t. As BT regained consciousness in the hospital, she was transferred to the step-down unit before being sent home, where she was able to make a full recovery. Gallon of anything challenge, is never worth it. Thanks so much for watching. Take care of yourself. And Be Well.

JS is a 36 year old man, presenting to the emergency room with breakthrough abdominal pain. He tries to tell the admitting nurse what was happening, but he had to grip the armrests of his chair to stop himself from emptying his stomach on to her shoes, again. You see, JS was a man living the dream. When he was growing up in the 80s, he was always around video games. His parents liked playing them. But, JS didn’t have friends who played video games, because he really didnt have any friends at all. When he was 14 in 1998, Pokemon had just come out. Some of the Pokemon in Red and Blue could only be had if players traded with each other on their gameboys, but because JS didn’t have any friends, he could never make the trades needed to get those Pokemon. As the years passed, what JS didn’t have as a kid, he tried as hard as he could to have as an adult. If he couldn’t have Gengar when he was young, that’s a Pokemon that required a trade to get, then JS had a lot of Gengar as an adult. If there were games and movies he didnt have as a kid, he had them as an adult. But these were material things. If he didnt have friends and recognition as a kid, then he tried as hard as he could to get them as an adult. One day, at his workplace, JS thought it would be funny to chug some energy drinks. The admin loved to stock them in the fridge, and the company always touted the drinks as a wonderful benefit for a great place to work. At the table now, JS wanted to put on a show. He was going to chug 12 energy drinks in 10 minutes, and it was going to be legendary. At first it felt cold on the way down. He could feel the burn at the back of his throat. But as the cans continued, the burn started to become discomfort as it felt like sores were growing and tearing up his mouth. Immediately after chugging all 12 energy drinks, JS didn’t feel well. The bottom of his chest was burning. He wasn’t sure if it was his stomach or his heart hurting. He was short of breath and to take his mind off of everything, he started playing some games. As the hours passed, JS could feel his heart fluttering. But this shouldn’t be happening, he thought. For him, caffeine really never had much of an effect. Even if the max daily recommendation is 400 milligrams a day, JS easily pushed seven, eight, nine hundred milligrams during LAN parties and weekend gaming marathons. I must just have good genetics to breakdown caffeine quickly, he thought. What started as a discomfort at the bottom of his chest started radiating out to his back, in-between his shoulder blades. JS knew he was wired, he could feel it all throughout the night while he was playing games and watching his friends stream. He thought taking a small shot of some other drink could help relieve some of this pain. But problems started happening when JS emptied his stomach into the kitchen sink. He had been feeling nauseous for several hours. After letting it all go in the sink, he started feeling even worse. He could feel his heart beat in his eyes. The back pain would burn just under his neck, and the pain in his stomach would come in waves, each one more intense than the last. Any time he tried drinking some water, that water would come right back up. JS tried holding out for a few days, because he believed that none of this could have been the energy drinks. Those should have already passed through his body, so it must be something else.   But finally, JS couldn’t eat anymore. He couldn’t drink anything anymore. And the pain was so sharp and burning as he calls for 911, and he’s brought to the emergency room where we are now. Doctors noticed that JS was nauseous. He had already thrown up on the nurse’s shoes. His breathing was stressed and he said that his abdominal pain would radiate to his back, like someone had taken a crowbar and started prying it apart. A blood test finds that JS has hyperglycemia. Hyper meaning high. Glyce referring to glucose, another name for sugar. And -emia meaning presence in blood. High sugar presence in blood. Each can that JS drank had more than 50 grams of sugar. 12 cans means that he chugged over 1 pound of sugar in 10 minutes, so hyperglycemia should make sense. But the problem is that he chugged those energy drinks more than a day ago. He hadn’t eaten anything afterwards because his abdomen just hurt so much. And the body typically tries to get rid of excess blood sugar as quickly as possible, so sugar shouldn’t be high in his blood. The pancreas releases insulin to help lower blood sugar. JS has abdominal pain, and the pancreas is in the abdomen. There could be a problem with his pancreas, maybe it’s not releasing insulin. Maybe something is blocking it from releasing insulin, or maybe it is releasing it, and his body isn’t responding to that insulin. This could mean that JS has diabetes. But that isn’t in his medical record, and another test of his long term blood sugar levels suggest he had prediabetes. But with the pain and the vomiting, doctors have a different idea of what could be happening. In the emergency room, doctors use an ultrasound machine to get an idea of what’s happening to JS’s pancreas. Maybe a gall stone is blocking it, backing up flow, and causing problems. But they didn’t see anything there. As they sent him in for a higher resolution scan, more results come back from the lab— JS has hyperlipasemia. High Lipase Presence in Blood. Lip from Greek Lipos referring to lipids, or fats, and -ase referring to enzyme. High fat degrading enzyme, presence in blood. Lipase comes from the pancreas. It helps us digest the fats we eat from our diet. If its levels are high in the blood, then it means the pancreas is leaking it out. And if it digests fat, and the pancreas is partially made of fat, then it means that JS’s pancreas is starting to digest itself. The abdominal pain radiating to his back. The nonstop nausea and vomiting. The inability to keep anything down and the hyperlipasemia. All of these together meaning JS has acute pancreatitis. -ITIS meaning an inflammation of the pancreas, because something happened to it, enzymes started leaking out of it, and now it’s starting to digest itself. Acute meaning this is all happening suddenly, and the medical team wants to know why. In the emergency room, doctors don’t know that JS chugged 12 energy drinks in 10 mintues. He didn’t tell them that. What doctors do ask him, is if JS consumes a lot of alcohol. Because he’s young, excess alcohol may not have permanently damaged the liver yet— that takes some time, but it can hurt the pancreas suddenly. It’s the second most common reason for pancreatitis, after gallstones, which the ultrasound showed, he didn’t have. JS did say he did have one shot of liquor when the pain started. They took his word for it. But they were suspicious thinking that it could have been more than just a shot, but the reality was he took the shot several hours after the pain had already become severe, and doctors just had no idea about the 12 energy drinks. JS was started on IV fluids. He was dehydrated because he couldn’t keep any water down. They give him medicines for the pain because it’s so excruciating, and everything seemed to be going OK. But only for a short time. When body parts appear to be damaged, the immune system reacts. This is to protect you. The problem is, sometimes the immune system overreacts. And it does that overreaction, when it shouldn’t be reacting in the first place. JS’s pancreas digesting itself is body part damage, so the immune system is there trying to protect him from that damage. But when inflammation, pancreat-ITIS, happens, the area can start to swell with fluid. And in JS, where his pancreas was supposed to be, is starting to swell with fluid. Typically in a 36 year old man with no diagnosed past medical history, this kind of pancreatitis resolves itself. The medical team elects to watch and wait, because even though his abdomen is swelling with fluid, doing surgery and cutting him open could be doing more harm than good. Even if the image looks scary, the body has a way of healing itself. And as a few days pass, things seemed to be holding steady, JS probably didnt need to have that surgery, and he’s probably ready to go home, they thought. As the medical team gets ready to discharge him from the hospital, everything seems to be going smoothly. But as the hours pass, JS starts to get chills. He starts running a fever, as his blood pressure starts to drop. His heart is trying to keep up by pumping harder and faster, but it’s not enough. Another CT scan finds that gas is now in the space where the fluid was swelling. The stomach and the intestines have some air in them, but they’re usually closed off so their contents don’t leak in to the abdomen, so if JS’s stomach isn’t punctured, then where could this gas be coming from? A blood test finds that not only are JS’s liver and kidneys starting to shut down now, but that he now has an infection. If bacteria and fungus floating around in the abdomen, outside of the stomach, can produce gas, then it means that fluid buildup from his inflamed pancreas, is now infected. But it doesnt just stop there. Whatever is infecting him, has now spilled in to his bloodstream. The immune system detects this and tries to react again by dilating the body’s blood vessels. But this drops the blood pressure. Adequate oxygen can’t get to organs like the liver and the kidneys, as they start to shut down. JS comes in and out of conscious as limited oxygen gets to his brain. All of this happening from pancreatitis in JS, that came from chugging excess energy drinks, as he finally utters to the medical team what happened. But why did this happen? Good question. Generally, most people know that energy drinks can be dangerous when consumed in huge excess. If you have one once in a while, and you’re young and healthy, it’s probably not a big deal. But if you start chugging multiple cans back to back, then bad things are probably going to happen. Most people immediately think of the caffeine content. Each can that JS drank had 160 milligrams of caffeine, so 2 cans get you very close to the recommended daily limit. Too much caffeine can make you wired, make your heart race, your breathing will become fast, it’ll make you shaky and jumpy, and in some people, lots of caffeine will feel like a panic attack. This energy drink cardiotoxicity, has been well documented. Check out this video from my cardiologist friend MedLifeCrisis, link in the description below. Energy drinks are more than just caffeine. And we dont know exactly how much of any one of these ingredients are in a single can. No one intended for someone to chug 5 and a half liters of anything in 10 minutes. What we do know, is there might be an association with excess energy drink consumption, and pancreatitis. It’s not just the caffeine and stimulants in there that’ll get you in the heart. Whether it’s chugging 12 cans in 10 minutes, or drinking three, four, five, six cans a day everyday, the pancreas can get injured. We can’t experiment on people in this setting— because we can’t give everyone huge amounts of energy drink until their pancreas starts digesting itself. And of the people who do drink 6 cans a day, we can’t cut them open and look at their pancreas at any given time, because it’s buried so deep inside the human body. For JS, this became a wake up call to him for his health. He didn’t have diabetes, but the blood test said pre-diabetes. He didn’t have hypertriglyceridemia, which can come from diabetes and cause pancreatitis. But the lesson is pancreatitis can spiral out of control very quickly, even when the patient looks great and ready to go home, just like JS. He was holding steady, until his organs just suddenly shut down because the inflammation got infected, and spilled in to his blood. With supportive care, and antibiotics. A diligent medical team, and a renewed sense of life, realizing he had everything he could ever want, JS was able to make a recovery.  If you’re interested in the Presenting To The Emergency Room mug, or other Chubbyemu merch, link to my store is in the description below.

This Is What Happened To His Kidneys. HC is a 26 year old man, presenting to the emergency room with hematuria, the urination of blood. He tells the admitting nurse that over the last few months, what started as a tickle sensation in his back had developed into a pain that would radiate down into his legs. You see, HC was like most Americans born in the middle 1980s. When he graduated college in 2008, the economy crashed. None of his classmates could find jobs. Without good prospects for work, HC started to panic. He thought to himself that more school, medical or graduate, could be the answer for him. And while he was working any part time job that he could get, he would study for the entrance exams needed to get in to those programs. Because his work was part time, HC didn’t have health insurance. But maybe he didn’t need it. He was young, he was active, he played sports, and his whole family had always been healthy. Dad was ex military, so everything was fine, he thought. One day, 3 years after he graduated college, HC felt a tickle on the right side of his back. Whenever this would come up, he would press his thumb in to the area, but it was deep inside his body. He felt it was an itch that he just couldn’t scratch. Over the next few weeks, the tickle would intensify, and HC would press his thumb in to his back harder and harder, until finally one day, it didn’t tickle anymore. It started to hurt. Unsure what this was all about, HC thought that maybe he was pressing his thumb too hard into his back, maybe he had injured a muscle or a ligament or maybe his mattress was too stiff. Around this time he developed a cough that wouldn’t go away. He thought it was allergies. He called his sister who lived in the mountains, to see if he could go visit her. Fresh air and a different mattress to sleep on would help take his mind off all the stress in his life. And everything went well. But when he came home, the pain returned. The cough got worse. And while this was happening, he started noticing something weird with his urine. Sometimes, he’d just take a little sip of water, and then urinate out what seemed like gallons of water. The urine wasn’t concentrated, but it wasn’t proportional to the amount that he was drinking. But then things started getting worse. One day, HC went to use the bathroom. What should have been urine was splashes of red blood everywhere in the toilet. In disbelief at the scene, HC thought maybe this was some kind of kidney stone that had, ripped apart some of his kidneys? On the internet, HC started Googling “blood in urine. ” The first result returned “cancer,” “but how could that be?” he thought. He was only 26, and cancer’s a disease that comes with age, so there’s no way this was happening. The second result returned kidney stones, so he felt hopeful. Without insurance, HC was hesitant about going to the hospital, but that sight of red in the toilet was so jarring to him that he brought himself to the emergency room, where we are now. At examination, HC was conscious and alert. He explained to the nurses what had been going down. Hematuria isn’t normal, for anyone. Maybe it was a kidney stone so they sent him in for a CT scan of his kidneys. HC was hopeful. But then doctors ordered a second scan. They thought that they saw something on that first scan, so they wanted to dive deeper. As the hours passed, HC started to become anxious. Everything pointed to the possibility, that this was more than just kidney stones. And as the attending physician came back, he told HC that what was in his right kidney, was cancer. The tickle in his back becoming a pain. The pain radiating down to his legs. The blood in the urine and the progressively worsening cough. All of this connected in HC’s mind, as he realized that everything that had been happening over the last few months late stage cancer growing and spreading everywhere. But HC’s time in the emergency room was over. His care needed to be transferred to another department that could take more care of him. At discharge, the emergency room doctor wrote on the notes that HC’s case was likely a particular kind of kidney cancer called Renal Medullary Carcinoma, based on his demographics. That he is a man in his 20s, of African descent with a Sickle Cell gene, and with a tumor growing on his right kidney. Cancer isn’t supposed to be diagnosed in the emergency room, because when it is, it means that the disease is so advanced, that all the signs and symptoms are immediately obvious to pick out. And when the cancer is advanced, there might not be much time left for that person. But how exactly did HC get cancer like this, at this age? This brings us back to demographics. The emergency room doctor noted that HC had sickle cell trait, but what does that mean? Red blood cells are responsible for moving oxygen throughout the body. Inside red blood cells is a protein that carries that oxygen called hemoglobin. Human DNA is the instructions to create all the proteins in our body, meaning, if some of the DNA is mutated, then the proteins might turn out a little different. In people of African descent, there’s a mutation in the DNA for hemoglobin. It’s well known. At least 300 million people worldwide have it. When hemoglobin is just a little different than normal, the shape of the red blood cell becomes sharp like a sickle. We think this mutation happened because it protects people from malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitos that’s common in areas by the Equator, like Africa. And it’s this sickle hemoglobinopathy, -opathy referring to a disorder of hemoglobin, causing the cell to become sickle shape, that’s one part the cause of HC’s cancer, but it’s only the start of his problems. You see, sickle cell trait is a little different than sickle cell disease. And because Sickle Cell Trait doesn’t have the word disease in its name, people think it’s not a problem, because “at least it’s not disease. ” You see, humans have 2 copies of any given gene in their DNA. In sickle cell disease, both genes have the sickle mutation, meaning many red blood cells floating around are sickle shaped. They clump together and block the blood vessels, causing massive pain and kidney damage. But in sickle cell trait, only 1 of the genes has the sickle mutation, the other gene has no problem. Sickle cell trait means that none of the red blood cells are sickle shaped, so none of that blocking happens in the body, except for when those red blood cells are in the kidneys. I explain more in this video on my second channel Heme Review, link in the description below. Dr Pavlos Msaouel: If the oxygen levels are reduced to very low levels, then, even if you have sickle cell trait, the red blood cells will change shape into sickles. But most people, some medical professionals included, don’t know that red blood cells in sickle cell trait will sickle in the kidneys, as HC would find out very quickly. When he called the doctors office, HC instantly got problems. Despite having authorization from the emergency room to see someone, the receptionist was adamant— their office wasn’t accepting new patients, especially ones without insurance. Back in the emergency room, HC got that doctor to schedule the appointment. But as the time got closer, a receptionist called and the appointment was moved back several months. Months that HC didn’t have because cancer was spreading in his body. One of his sisters worked at the hospital and she was able to get his appointment moved earlier, but he had to drive to a clinic hours away. He didn’t understand why getting a confirmation of what kind of kidney cancer he had was so difficult. But at this first visit, that doctor didn’t think he had cancer at all. They started by asking HC about being born overseas because of his military father. And cancer doesn’t happen in young people, as you know, so this is probably an STD that HC had picked up while he was overseas, probably HIV, because HIV damages the kidneys, maybe causes hematuria explaining that. All of this despite the fact that this practitioner didn’t test HC for HIV. After this visit, the department scheduled an MRI for HC, but in 5 months time. If HC has late stage cancer spreading all throughout his body, he might not be alive in 5 months. He tried anything he could to get an earlier MRI, but nothing happened. In the weeks that passed, HC called that doctor to tell him about his worsening cough. Adamant that this was HIV, the doctor believed that this was the opportunistic lung infection you find in someone with HIV. They ordered HC to go to the hospital and get a chest Xray. Except, the doctors who did that Xray could immediately see, that wasn’t HIV pneumonia in his lungs, that was cancer from his kidney that had spread to his lungs. Those doctors were much more concerned about his health, but they were doctors who operated inside the hospital. They weren’t the ones in charge of his care. A sample of HC’s kidney was taken and looked at underneath a microscope. All of this confirmed— HC has renal medullary carcinoma. It’s growing in his right kidney. It’s spread to his lungs. But it was shrugged it off. The doctor said to HC that they can do surgery to remove the cancerous kidney, but only if HC wants. In the emergency room one night, HC was told by staff that not having insurance put him at the bottom of the list. But it doesn’t explain why his doctor immediately thought HC had an STD. Or why he thought that HC may have had a urinary tract infection, when emergency room notes didn’t indicate any infection. Or why he thought that HC had HIV, without bothering to test for it. A few days earlier, HC had looked online. He was on a patient forum discussing Renal Medullary Carcinoma. He noticed someone who kept appearing in the searches. A doctor in Texas, who did research and wrote papers on it. Late at night on a Saturday, thinking that there may not be anything else left to lose, HC sent this Dr Nizar Tannir an email explaining his situation. He didn’t think that he would get a response, but that really wouldn’t be any different than what he was already getting. But in just a few minutes time, HC got something back. Dr Tannir: I responded to him and said, “Do not despair. There is hope. And I will see you in the clinic when I return. ” In the emails, Dr Tannir had told HC that chemotherapy first, then surgery, is how you treat this particular kidney cancer. That’s the opposite from all other kinds of kidney cancers. But when HC brought up the idea of chemotherapy first to that doctor, the response was just like all the other responses that he had gotten from this person. But it didn’t matter. HC had made up his mind- he was going to go to Texas, to see Dr Tannir. On the drive from South Carolina to Houston, HC’s cancer was so advanced that his family didn’t speak to him during the whole 17 hour trip, because if he tried to say anything or laugh, he would just cough uncontrollably because cancer was everywhere in his lungs. In Dr Tannir’s hospital, they quickly confirmed renal medullary carcinoma. HC was given a treatment plan. They would start on chemotherapy. This would kill cancer cells and shrink the tumor. They would see how HC responds to the chemotherapy, and then they would remove his cancerous kidney. This all sounded great, but HC still didn’t have insurance. He had some family who lived in Texas who he could stay with if he were to get this treatment, but he didn’t know how this could all be done, and he was afraid he’d be treated the same way that he was at the previous hospital. But Dr Tannir and his staff were able to obtain an override for HC so that he could start to receive the treatment. And by the third day of arriving to that hospital, he was started on chemotherapy. The confusion of sickle cell trait versus disease. The young age of diagnosis. The idea of removing the kidney first like in every other kidney cancer, but doing that in this cancer would decrease patient survival. All of this contributes to renal medullary carcinoma being an under recognized disease. Wikipedia still emphasizes that as of 2009 only 120 cases of RMC have been reported. But looking through literature, there’s cases that were misidentified as a different kind of kidney cancer called Collecting Duct Carcinoma. We know now, that’s probably RMC. It downplays the incidence. And unfortunately, that downplaying manifests in the real world, to the care of actual patients, bringing us back to HC’s case. As the weeks and months passed, support from HC’s family helped him continue his treatment. After 5 cycles of chemotherapy, the cancer couldn’t be seen on scans of his lungs and kidneys, but that doesn’t mean he’s out of the woods just yet. The tumor might just be so small, that the scans don’t pick it up. And we know a small mass can grow back into a large mass, as he was sent in for surgery. Samples of his right kidney were taken and looked at underneath a microscope. The cancer had gone from a large mass visible on CT scan, to a small residual focus. But the work wasn’t finished. HC was continued at first on different medicines. They weren’t chemotherapy, they were pills for a clinical trial. But then they noticed that the tumors were starting to grow again, as they stopped that medicine, and restarted him on chemotherapy. And it seemed to work, because as the time continued, each scan for HC returned clear again. The cancer that was in his lungs had disappeared. His cough went away. He didn’t have a right kidney anymore, but his left kidney had no cancer on it. His bones were clean, and nothing was found on his liver. HC wouldn’t be here if he had listened and believed he had HIV. Or went along with the original doctor and had his kidney taken out before getting chemotherapy. Had he not sent that email to Dr Tannir and had he not had help from his family. 2 years after presenting to the emergency room and being diagnosed with Renal Medullary Carcinoma, Dr Tannir decided to give HC a break from chemotherapy, because the cancer was no longer showing up on the scans. At the 5 year mark, HC was declared cancer free. And as of 2021, almost 10 years since his diagnosis, he is one of the documented survivors of Renal Medullary Carcinoma. Patient HC: My name is Herman Connor. And I’m an RMC Survivor. Thanks so much for watching. Take care of yourself. And Be Well.

This Is How His Kidneys Shut Down. JG is 44 year old man, presenting to the emergency room with hematuria. Over the last week, he ate only peanuts and washed it down with liquor. His water intake was zero. A blood test tells doctors that JG’s kidneys have shut down, and this could make sense because peanuts are rich in oxalate, which reacts with calcium in the blood to form calcium oxalate, a solid salt that doesn’t dissolve in water. In his kidneys, calcium oxalate built up and nucleated into crystals, while shredding apart his kidneys apart, causing them to fail, confirmed on biopsy. JG’s hydration status declined every day because liquor is a diuretic, and without adequate water circulating through his kidneys, calcium oxalate crystals deposited, inflamed the tissue, and caused necrosis and kidney failure. After 15 days in the hospital and after several dialysis sessions, JG started to make his own urine again, as he made a full recovery. Thanks for watching. Stay hydrated, and be well.
